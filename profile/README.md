## Features

* Duolicious has a question bank containing over 2000 thoughtful and unique questions designed to help us gain authentic insight into your personality—But you don't need to answer them all to find your perfect match! Right after your first response, Duolicious shows your best matches so far—And the matches get better with every response you give. The questions are fun and easy-to-answer, while still giving the depth of insight Duolicious needs to match you with the right people. Our question bank covers a huge variety of topics, including values, faith, politics and sexual compatibility.

* As well as commonly used personality traits, like those measured by the MBTI, Duolicious shows you how you compare to other people based on psychometric traits like attachment style and thriftiness.

* Duolicious encourages genuine connections by eschewing low-effort signals such as liking and swiping on profiles. Instead, people introduce themselves simply by sending a message. To encourage meaningful conversations, Duolicious checks first messages for originality, and asks people to avoid overused openers like 'hey' and 'sup'.

* Unlike other dating apps, Duolicious is completely free and has no advertisements. Every user gets the full experience Duolicious has to offer. In return, our community supports us through [donations](https://ko-fi.com/duolicious), by sharing Duolicious with friends, and by contributing code.
