# Duolicious

Duolicious is for meeting like-minded people.

## Features

* Duolicious has a question bank containing over 1500 thoughtful and unique personality questions. With that many questions, users have more ways to express themselves than there are atoms in the known universe. The questions have been carefully curated to be fun while still giving authentic insight into our users' personalities. The questions cover a broad range of topics, including ethics, values, faith, and sexual compatibility.

* As well as commonly used personality traits, like those measured by the MBTI, Duolicious shows you how you compare to other users based on psychometric traits like attachment style and thriftiness.

* Duolicious encourages genuine connections by eschewing low-effort signals such as liking and swiping on profiles. Instead, users introduce themselves simply by sending a message. To encourage meaningful conversations, Duolicious checks first messages for originality, and asks users to avoid over-used openers like 'hey' and 'sup'.

* Unlike other dating apps, Duolicious is completely free and has no advertisements. Every user gets the full experience Duolicious has to offer. Users are able to donate, but are encouraged to donate no more than needed to cover our running costs. Our running costs and the option to donate are unobtrusively displayed only at one location, in the settings.
